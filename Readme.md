# Day 1

Started by reading the documentation [Testnet tBTC v2 node Setup](https://docs.threshold.network/app-development/ropsten-testnet-staking/testnet-tbtc-v2-node-setup). I could not find where the doc's respository is located in case I wanted to fork it and make a PR. This would be useful in care anyone from the community wants to contribute to the documentation.

I carefully read the [Ethereum API](https://docs.threshold.network/app-development/ropsten-testnet-staking/testnet-tbtc-v2-node-setup#ethereum-api) section and it is useful because it contains a list of requirements the node setup needs to have.

I chose to use Digital Ocean and started with Ubuntu `22.04 LTS` shared CPU Basic Droplet.
