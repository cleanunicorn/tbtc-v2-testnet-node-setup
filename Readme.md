# Day 1

## Part 1

I started with the povided [Gist](https://gist.github.com/sashatanase/9c0543a0db194080b956991fb91ee426).

### Testnet tBTC v2 node Setup

Started by reading the documentation [Testnet tBTC v2 node Setup](https://docs.threshold.network/app-development/ropsten-testnet-staking/testnet-tbtc-v2-node-setup). I could not find where the doc's respository is located in case I wanted to fork it and make a PR. This would be useful in care anyone from the community wants to contribute to the documentation.

I carefully read the [Ethereum API](https://docs.threshold.network/app-development/ropsten-testnet-staking/testnet-tbtc-v2-node-setup#ethereum-api) section and it is useful because it contains a list of requirements the node setup needs to have.

I chose to use Digital Ocean and started with Ubuntu `22.04 LTS` shared CPU Basic Droplet.

Digital Ocean Hostname `ubuntu-s-2vcpu-2gb-amd-nyc1-01`.

I started by [installing `geth`](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/install-and-build/installing-geth#ubuntu-via-ppas).

Set a password for my account:

```sh
$ geth account new --keystore ./operator-key
```

I don't need to configure a firewall and open the specified blocks because this VM is only used for this purpose. I will not be running any other services on it. It doesn't make sense to set up a firewall if I allow all of the open ports anyway.

### Application Authorization

Going next to [Application Authorization](https://docs.threshold.network/app-development/ropsten-testnet-staking/testnet-tbtc-v2-node-setup#application-authorization)

There is no link to the dashboard in the documentation. I found the link by searching the initially provided [Onboarding Gist](https://gist.github.com/sashatanase/9c0543a0db194080b956991fb91ee426) to point to the testnet.

A list of links to multiple networks can be provided in the doc also ([testnet](https://dashboard.test.threshold.network/overview/network) included). 

I used the public address `[0x73892cf1aa96131732b8a4a071a3e83b167f14be](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x73892cf1aa96131732b8a4a071a3e83b167f14be)` to connect to the dashboard.

If I am not on the the right network, this is the error I get:

![Dashboard screenshot - wrong network](./static/SCR-20221019-sa0.png)

Being on the right network, it's unclear what the next step is in the displayed dashboard.

![Dashboard screenshot - where is "Configure Apps"](./static/SCR-20221019-sg1.png).

The link to "Configure Apps" is not obvious, but I started by staking, already knowing I will need to configure apps at some point. Others might have a harder time figuring out what to do next.

I returned a few hours later after I staked the 50,000 T tokens.

I staked all the tokens I have (50,000 T) but I only selected 40,000 T to pool for the `TBTC` and `RANDOM BEACON APP` apps. I did not stake the remaining 10,000 T because I want to keep them to increase the pool in the future, to see how the experience is like.

I configured each app to use 40,000 T tokens and was guided by the UI to activate each application separately since that was the primary action button.

![Activate pool for apps](./static/SCR-20221019-wz5.png)

The fact that I can activate both apps at the same time is not obvious. I had to click on each app checkbox separately to activate them. and then click on the `Authorize selected apps` button.

Unfortunately Metamask doesn't always decode txs successfully. I had to manually decode the txs to see what they were doing.

![Metamask decode 1](./static/SCR-20221019-x1a.png)
![Metamask decode 2](./static/SCR-20221019-x1y.png)

I sent the first transaction and waited for the tx to be mined in the UI and it asked me to sign a second tx, for the second application. Both txs were mined successfully.

I saw in the docs that the screenshots guide me to use the UI as described above, trying to activate both apps at the same time, even though this still needs 2 txs to finalize.

Because I did not see the "Start mapping" link in the UI, I refreshed the page. Everytime I refresh the page, I need to reconnect my wallet to the dashboard. I think the wallet should remain connected.

Once I refreshed the page a modal apeared asking me to map the address, to which I provided the address generated on the Digital Ocean server (the account generated by `geth`).

I had again to sign and broadcast 2 txs, 1 for each app.

A modal with a confetty animation appeared, congratulating me for mapping the addresses, but the confetti was hidden by a web element, making it almost impossible to see.
